# Wheel Support assembly

This repository showcases a complete 3D CAD model of a wheel support assembly, including all individual components and the final assembled model. It's designed to serve as a portfolio piece, demonstrating detailed mechanical design and assembly capabilities.

# Features

Detailed Components: Individual CAD files for each part of the wheel support .

Full Assembly: A complete assembly model demonstrating the interaction and fit of all components.

Standard Formats: Provided in original SolidWorks native files and widely compatible STEP format.

Design Intent: Created as a practice project to demonstrate proficiency in SolidWorks.

# About Me

Hello! I'm Deven Gorkha, a student currently pursuing B.E. in Mechanical Engineering from P.E.S. Modern College of Engineering in Pune, Maharashtra, India. My primary CAD experience is with SolidWorks, but I am actively expanding my skillset and aim to become proficient in other CAD software soon.

This wheel support assembly demonstrates my skills in mechanical component design, assembly modeling, and engineering visualization.
